# Deploy HillSequencer to the RG35XXSP (muOS) over SSH from your Mac.
#
# Usage:
#   bash deploy.sh [host] [sd_root]
#   HOST defaults to 192.168.1.201, SD_ROOT to /mnt/sdcard.
#
# muOS builds the Ports menu from <sd>/ROMS/Ports/*.sh, while game code lives in
# lowercase <sd>/ports/<name>/. So we place them SEPARATELY (a launcher left in
# lowercase ports/ would NOT appear in the menu):
#   launcher -> /mnt/sdcard/ROMS/Ports/HillSequencer.sh
#   code     -> /mnt/sdcard/ports/hillsequencer/
# Samples are shared with HillChord at /mnt/sdcard/ROMs/Samples (already there).
#
# Auth: the device's SSH password is "root". By default scp/ssh will PROMPT for
# it (a few times). To avoid prompts, install sshpass and export SSHPASS=root:
#   brew install hudochenkov/sshpass/sshpass   &&   SSHPASS=root bash deploy.sh
